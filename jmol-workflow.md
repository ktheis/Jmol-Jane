# Jmol Figure Creation Workflow

## Initial User Assessment
- What molecule/structure are you trying to visualize?
- What scientific question or feature are you trying to highlight?
- Do you have the structure file already, or do you need help obtaining it?
- What's your experience level with Jmol?

## Step 1: Setting Up the Basic View
- Loading the structure file
- Initial orientation adjustments
- Setting appropriate display style (ribbon, spacefill, ball & stick, etc.)
- Basic coloring schemes (by element, chain, secondary structure)

## Step 2: Focusing on the Feature of Interest
- Selection commands for specific regions/atoms
- Ask user to make sure selections are as intended
- Highlighting important residues or interactions
- Adding measurements (distances, angles)
- Creating custom selections for different components

## Step 3: Visual Enhancements
- Background color adjustment
- Lighting and shadow settings
- Transparency options
- Label creation and formatting

## Step 4: Testing and Debugging the Script
- Make sure coordinates are loaded from the PDB, not from a local file
- Run the script at https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/simple.htm
- Ask user to share:
  - Screenshot of the visualization
  - Any console output/errors
  - Initial impressions of the result

### Phase 1: Syntax Correction
- Identify and fix any syntax errors in the script
- Address command formatting issues
- Resolve any loading or initialization problems
- Confirm the script runs without errors

### Phase 2: Selection Verification
- Confirm atom selections target the correct elements/residues
- Verify all intended elements are displayed properly
- Check measurements and labels for accuracy
- Ensure color schemes and styles are applied to correct selections

### Phase 3: Visual Enhancement and 3D Optimization
- Discuss aesthetic improvements for clearer communication
- Adjust perspective, depth, and orientation for 3D clarity
- Consider multiple views/angles for complex features
- Ensure the visualization works well when rotated interactively
- Refine lighting, shadows, and transparency for optimal 3D effect

## Step 5: Script Creation and Saving
- Combining commands into a cohesive script
- Testing and refining the script
- Saving the script for future use
- Exporting high-quality images

## Common Examples (with scripts)
- Protein active site visualization
- DNA/RNA structure highlight
- Protein-ligand interaction
- Surface electrostatics visualization

## End-of-Session Reflection
- What worked well in the script creation process?
- What challenges were encountered?
- Which parts of the workflow were most/least helpful?
- What additional information would have been useful?

## Knowledge Capture Process
### Insights to Document
- Common user challenges
- Frequently requested features
- Effective explanations
- Useful script patterns
- Documentation gaps identified

### Implementation Options
- After meaningful sessions, review conversation and add key insights
- Ask users to contribute their learnings directly
- Suggest potential insights at the end of sessions

### Periodic Review
- Look for patterns across multiple sessions
- Refine workflow based on accumulated insights
- Update cheat sheet with new examples and solutions
